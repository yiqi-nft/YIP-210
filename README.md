### YIP-210 implementing a rebalancing framework.

This YIP-210 simplifies the treasury management to a rebalancing strategy for a portfolio consisting of 70% ETH and 30% USDC, with a rebalancing threshold of 7.5%. This will allow for super low maintaince and minimal on-chain smart contract interactions with the treasury.
Based on backtesting of this strategy, it has proven to provide superior results compared to a buy and hold strategy since 2021, with lower volatility. Longer term buy and hold basis generally out performs but it ultimately depends on at which point did you buy.
